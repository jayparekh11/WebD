# React Meeting Notes App

This project is designed as a part of a learning assignment focused on React.js and integrating it with a Node.js backend. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete meeting notes, making it a practical tool for managing meeting summaries and action items.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, view, edit, and delete meeting notes.
- **Material UI**: Utilizes MaterialUI for a sleek and responsive user interface.
- **State Management**: Demonstrates the use of React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing state and side effects.
- **Data Persistence**: Interacts with a Node.js backend to persist data in a database through REST APIs.
- **Search Functionality**: Includes a feature to search and filter meeting notes based on keywords and date ranges.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, MaterialUI for styling.
- **Backend**: Node.js server (from a previous assignment) providing REST APIs.
- **Database**: Any database used in the backend (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) for storing meeting notes.
- **Build Tool**: Vite for an optimized development and build process.


#### Starting the Application

1. **Start the Server**:

- Navigate to the server code directory.
- Install dependencies.

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Start the server.
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

2. **Start the Client**:

- Navigate to the client code directory.
- Install dependencies.
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Start the development server.
